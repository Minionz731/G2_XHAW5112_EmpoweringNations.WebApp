                    The SME, founded by Precious Radebe, offers skills training for domestic workers and gardeners, 
                    inspired by her desire to help others in her community who, like her parents, 
                    didnâ€™t have opportunities to pursue formal education or skill development. {"\n\n"}


                    Her training equips domestic workers and gardeners with valuable skills,
                     making them more competitive for higher-paying jobs and enabling them to start their own small businesses. 
                     Many employers also appreciate having more skilled workers who can offer enhanced services at home.
